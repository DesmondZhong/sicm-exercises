;; :END:

;; This exercise completes exercise 1.10 by asking for implementations of the
;; higher-order Lagrange equations that we derived. This was a nice Scheme
;; exercise; I would argue that this implementation should exist in the standard
;; library. But that would ruin the fun of the exercise...

;; Part A: Acceleration-dependent Lagrangian Implementation

;; From the book:

;; #+begin_quote
;; Write a procedure to compute the Lagrange equations for Lagrangians that depend
;; upon acceleration, as in exercise 1.10. Note that Gamma can take an optional
;; argument giving the length of the initial segment of the local tuple needed. The
;; default length is 3, giving components of the local tuple up to and including
;; the velocities.
;; #+end_quote

;; Now that we know the math, the implementation is a straightforward extension of
;; the =Lagrange-equations= procedure presented in the book:


(define ((Lagrange-equations3 L) q)
  (let ((state-path (Gamma q 4)))
    (+ ((square D) (compose ((partial 3) L) state-path))
       (- (D (compose ((partial 2) L) state-path)))
       (compose ((partial 1) L) state-path))))
;; Part B: Applying HO-Lagrangians

;; Now it's time to use the new function. From the book:

;; #+begin_quote
;; Use your procedure to compute the Lagrange equations for the Lagrangian

;; \begin{equation}
;; L(t, x, v, a) = - {1 \over 2}mxa - {1 \over 2}kx^2
;; \end{equation}

;; Do you recognize the resulting equation of motion?
;; #+end_quote

;; Here is the Lagrangian described in the problem:


(define ((L-1-13 m k) local)
  (let ((x (coordinate local))
        (a (acceleration local)))
    (- (* -1/2 m x a)
       (* 1/2 k (square x)))))


;; #+RESULTS:
;; : #| L-1-13 |#

;; Use the new function to generate the Lagrange equations. This call includes a
;; factor of $-1$ to make the equation look nice:


(->tex-equation
 (- (((Lagrange-equations3 (L-1-13 'm 'k))
      (literal-function 'x)) 't)))
;; Part C: Generalized Lagrange Equations

;; Now, some more fun with Scheme. It just feels nice to implement Scheme
;; procedures. From the book:

;; #+begin_quote
;; For more fun, write the general Lagrange equation procedure that takes a
;; Lagrangian that depends on any number of derivatives, and the number of
;; derivatives, to produce the required equations of motion.
;; #+end_quote

;; As a reminder, this is the equation that we need to implement for each
;; coordinate:

;; \begin{equation}
;;   0 = \sum_{i = 0}^n(-1)^i D^{i}(\partial_{i+1}L \circ \Gamma[q])
;; \end{equation}

;; There are two ideas playing together here. Each term takes an element from:

;; - an alternating sequence of $1$ and $-1$
;; - a sequence of increasing-index $D^i(\partial_i L \circ \Gamma[q])$ terms

;; The alternating $1, -1$ sequence is similar to a more general idea: take any
;; ordered collection arranged in a cycle, start at some point and walk around the
;; cycle for $n$ steps.

;; If you need to take $n$ steps along a cycle of length $l$, you'll end up
;; traveling around the cycle between $n \over l$ and ${n \over l} + 1$ times.

;; =alternate= generates a list of $n$ total elements generated by walking around
;; the ordered cycle of supplied =elems=:


(define (cycle n elems)
  (apply append (make-list n elems)))

(define (alternating n elems)
  (let* ((l (length elems))
         (times (quotient (+ n (-1+ l)) l)))
    (list-head (cycle times elems) n)))


;; #+RESULTS:
;; : #| cycle |#
;; :
;; : #| alternating |#

;; Now, the general =Lagrange-equations*= implementation.

;; This function defines an internal function =term= that generates the $i$th term
;; of the derivative combination described above. This sequence is zipped with the
;; sequence of $1, -1$, and =fold-left= generates the sum.


(define ((Lagrange-equations* L n) q)
  (let ((state-path (Gamma q (1+ n))))
    (define (term i)
      ((expt D i)
       (compose ((partial (1+ i)) L) state-path)))
    (let ((terms (map term (iota n))))
      (fold-left (lambda (acc pair)
                   (+ acc (apply * pair)))
                 0
                 (zip (alternating n '(1 -1))
                      (reverse terms))))))


;; #+RESULTS:
;; : #| Lagrange-equations* |#

;; Generate the Lagrange equations from part b once more to check that we get the
;; same result:


(->tex-equation
 (- (((Lagrange-equations* (L-1-13 'm 'k) 3)
      (literal-function 'x)) 't)))
